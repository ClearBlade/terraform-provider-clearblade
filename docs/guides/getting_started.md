# Getting Started with the ClearBlade Provider

# ClearBlade IoT Core Provider

The ClearBlade provider is used to configure your [ClearBlade IoT Core](https://iot.clearblade.com/iot-core/) infrastructure.

To learn the basics of Terraform using this provider, follow the hands-on
[get started tutorials](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/gcp-get-started/infrastructure-as-code).
For more involved examples, try [provisioning a GKE cluster](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/gke)
and deploying [Consul-backed Vault into it using Terraform Cloud](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/kubernetes-consul-vault-pipeline).

Already experienced with Terraform? Check out the [Getting Started](/docs/guides/getting_started.md)
page for a short introduction to using Terraform with ClearBlade IoT Core.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Service credential based configuration for the Clearblade IoT Core provider
